                <h2>How to Make Your Website Look Beautiful When You’re Not a Designer</h2>
                <h5><i>(Last Update On: January, 25 2023)</i></h5>
                <p>It might not seem like such a big deal, but the way your website looks matters a lot. In a recent
                    study by Forrester Research, they found that a well designed interface can increase conversion rates
                    on your website by 200%.</p><br>
                <p>But designing your own website is hard.</p><br>
                <p>Where do you start? Which font should you choose? Which color? Where should the menus go? These — and
                    many other questions — can make you give up before you even get started.</p><br>
                <h3>Step 1: Choose the Tools You’ll Use To Build Your Website</h3>
                <p>The many tools available online are what make it possible for you to design and construct your own
                    website without hiring a web designer.</p><br>
                <p>Right now, there are two ideal types of software you can use to design your website:</p><br>
                <p><b>1. Content Management System (CMS):</b>A content management system, like WordPress, is the easiest
                    tool with which you can design your website. That’s because it comes with templates, which are
                    ready-made website designs you can simply install and customize until you get the look you want.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>2. Website Builders:</b>A website builder is a drag-and-drop tool which lets you design a website
                    professionally without any special knowledge. You control the look of each and every element
                    (textbox, widget, button, etc.) and can change its design and location just by using your mouse.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you want to get through designing your website quickly, you should choose a CMS. But if you want
                    to have more control over the design of your website, you should choose a website builder.</p><br>
                <h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Website’s Wireframe</h3>
                <p><b>Note: If you’re going to use a CMS and its templates for your website’s design, you can skip this
                        step. But, if you’ll be starting from scratch with a website builder, read on.</b></p><br>
                <p>If you are really ambitious about creating a unique design for your website, you should start by
                    building a wireframe.</p><br>
                <p>A wireframe is a structural representation that shows what your website will look like. Think of it
                    as your website’s blueprint, which, like a blueprint for a house, will guide you on how to build
                    your website.</p><br>
                <p>Here is an example of a wireframe for Back To My Body’s website:</p><br>
                <img src="img/wireframe.jpg">
                <p>This simple wireframe gives a solid idea what the dashboard will look like.</p>
                <p>It shows</p><br>
                <p>1. The structure of the website</p>
                <p>2. The website’s navigational hierarchy</p>
                <p>3. Which content pieces will go where</p><br>
                <p>You don’t need to use fancy software to design your website’s wireframe. You can simply use a good
                    ol’ piece of paper and a pen to create a wireframe like this:</p><br>
                <img src="img/image5.png">
                <h3>Step 3: Identify What Pages Your Website Will Have</h3>
                <p>Before you start the wireframe process (or edit a template), you’re going to decide what pages your
                    website will have. And to do that, you’ll have to ask yourself what’s the number one thing you want
                    your website to do.</p><br>
                <p>Do you want it to sell products? Showcase information and articles? Tell what your service or
                    products are capable of? Introduce your company or business?</p><br>
                <p>Once you answer this question, it will become easier for you to decide what pages you want on your
                    website.</p><br>
                <p>Here are some common pages many websites have:</p><br>
                <p>1. Homepage</p>
                <p>2. Blog</p>
                <p>3. About Us</p>
                <p>4. Contact</p>
                <p>5. Pricing</p><br>
                <p>Of these pages, the most common page on every single website (which your website will have as well)
                    is the homepage.</p><br>
                <p>Traditionally, these are the parts into which a homepage is divided:</p><br>
                <p><b>1. Header:</b> The header generally includes your company/business logo, the secondary menu, and
                    other elements like the search box, cart widget, or something else.</p><br>
                <p><b>2. Primary Menu:</b> The primary menu includes navigation links to the pages your visitors will be
                    most interested in, and is central to your website. This can include links to your products,
                    services, articles, and more. The primary menu usually includes links to whole categories or main
                    sections.</p><br>
                <p><b>3. Secondary Menu:</b> The secondary menu includes links to secondary pages that aren’t central to
                    your website, but still need to be there. Some secondary menu items are ‘advertise’, ‘privacy
                    policy’, ‘terms of use’, and more.</p><br>
                <p><b>4. Main Content:</b> This is the main area of your website. It will introduce readers to your
                    website as well as highlight your latest products, announcements, services, and content.</p><br>
                <p><b>5. Sidebar:</b> A sidebar can include widgets such as a subscribe form, archive, social share
                    buttons, and other CTAs you might want your visitors to act on. The reason for that is sidebar items
                    stay in view no matter what page your visitors are on.</p><br>
                <p><b>6. Footer:</b> A footer acts as the last safety net for your website. Here, you can place
                    navigation links, sitemap, subscribe forms, widgets, and other things you might want your visitors
                    to click on before leaving your site. You can also add privacy policy, terms of use, and other
                    important pages in your footer as well.</p><br>
                <p>Once you list out the pages you want, you can start creating the wireframe of your website — or start
                    adding the pages to your template on WordPress.</p><br>
                <h3>Five Tips That Will Help You Design a Beautiful Website</h3>
                <p>Now that you know the basics of structuring your website, here are a few tips you should keep in mind
                    when designing it.</p><br>
                <h3>1. Start with Your Website’s Navigation Structure</h3>
                <p>When visitors land on your site, they should easily and quickly find what they are looking for. Good
                    navigation is responsible for making that happen.</p><br>
                <p>The way to do that is by dividing your content into categories and putting the links of these
                    categories in your primary and secondary menus.</p><br>
                <img src="img/image6.png">
                <p>The Microsoft website is a great example of this.</p><br>
                <p>Their primary menu only has four links, i.e., Store, Devices, Software, & Apps. Each menu item has
                    its own dropdown menu, which leads to another menu shown on the right side. </p><br>
                <p>This intelligent way of categorizing menu items makes it easy for users to find what they want and
                    prevents information overload at the same time.</p><br>
                <p>By cleverly using categories and subcategories — and by creating dropdown menus — you too can
                    simplify your website’s navigation and make it easy for your visitors to browse through your
                    website.</p><br>
                <p>Plus, creating a navigational structure will help you decide how many pages you need for your website
                    and where each page should go. This will be especially useful if you’re building a wireframe for
                    your website.</p><br>
                <h3>2. Create a Style Guide for Your Website</h3>
                <p>Spending time to create a style guide for your website is one of the most effective things you can do
                    to make your website beautiful.</p><br>
                <p>Your style guide dictates not only how your website will look, but also how your social media pages,
                    advertising banners, and other digital media assets look as well.</p><br>
                <p>There are five major components of a style guide. Let’s briefly discuss each one:</p><br>
                <p><b>1. Brand Story</b></p><br>
                <p>The first thing you need to do is introduce yourself to the world:</p><br>
                <p>Who are you? Why do you exist? What’s your mission? What’s your vision?</p><br>
                <p>These questions are important because, not only will your brand story help you attract the right
                    audience, but it will also help you set the basis for your website design’s ‘personality’.</p><br>
                <p>Will it be chic and jazzy? Warm and professional? Cool and corporate? Fun and energetic?</p><br>
                <p>The only way you’ll be able to decide this is if you have a brand story, accompanied by a vision,
                    mission statement, and a set of core values.</p><br>
                <p><b>2. Logo</b></p><br>
                <p>The next thing you need to decide for your website is your logo. There are many tools out there which
                    let you design your logo for free. But if you want to opt for something more professional, you can
                    hire a designer from marketplaces like Fiverr, Upwork, and 99Designs.</p><br>
                <p><b>3. Color Palette</b></p><br>
                <p>Your website needs to have a color which you’ll put in elements such as the logo, navigation menus,
                    backgrounds, images, and illustrations.</p><br>
                <p>To get started, you should choose a combination of three colors for your website:</p><br>
                <p>- A Primary Color</p><br>
                <p>- A Secondary Color</p><br>
                <p>- A Tertiary Color</p><br>
                <img src="img/image4-1.png">
                <p>This helpful chart by <b>BrightSide</b> shows a great way to choose a combination of three colors for
                    your website. For the perfect combo, all three of your colors should be equidistant from each other
                    on the circle which, when connected, form a perfect triangle.</p><br>
                <p>According to them, combining colors this way will <i>“produce a high contrast effect while preserving
                        ’harmony.’ Such a composition looks vibrant even when you use pale and unsaturated colors.”</i>
                </p><br>
                <p>You can apply the primary color with different hues to your website’s background and elements. Your
                    font can have the secondary color and should be dark. Your tertiary colors can be used in
                    conjunction with your primary and secondary colors to make them stand out, and therefore, should be
                    neutral.</p><br>
                <p><b>4. Typography</b></p><br>
                <p>In web design, fonts are a big part of your overall website’s design. That’s because they ‘speak’ to
                    your visitors and show them what kind of personality your website has.</p><br>
                <p>Want to look luxurious, classy, important, or casual? Choosing good typography is the best way to
                    convey that look.</p><br>
                <img src="img/image7.png">
                <p>As a rule of thumb, there are three fonts you should choose for your website. Any more than that and
                    your website will become confusing to your visitors.</p><br>
                <p>- The first font is your primary font. This font will be used in headings everywhere on your website,
                    and as such, should look big, bold, and demand attention from anyone who views it.</p><br>
                <p>- The next font is your secondary font. This will be used for the text. This font should be easy to
                    read, with plenty of spacing and shouldn’t be cursive or in a strange design. It should, however, be
                    easy to scan.</p><br>
                <p>- Finally, the last font you want on your website is the accent font. This font will be used in CTA
                    buttons, menu bars, and as an accent to your primary and secondary fonts.</p><br>
                <p>One thing you should keep in mind is, while the fonts will be different, they should compliment each
                    other. To understand how to do that, you can browse sites like Dribbble and Awwwards to get an idea
                    of how professional designers combine different fonts.</p><br>
                <p><b>5. Imagery and Illustrations</b></p><br>
                <p>Your website will need images or illustrations — or a combination of both. The images on your website
                    will be directly responsible for evoking the emotions of your visitors.</p><br>
                <p>That’s why choosing the right type of pictures is crucial for your website to set the right tone with
                    your audience.</p><br>
                <p>For example, if you’re selling shoes on your ecommerce store, you’ll want energetic images of people
                    running, hiking, climbing, and doing other high-intense activities. You wouldn’t want an image of a
                    person sleeping on their bed.</p><br>
                <p>Not only is it important to choose the right image, it is also important to make sure it’s of high
                    quality and looks genuine.</p><br>
                <h3>3. Make Sure Your Website’s Design Looks Clean and Uses Whitespace</h3>
                <p>Today, people have extremely low attention spans. That’s why you need to ensure your website looks
                    clean the moment your visitors land on it.</p><br>
                <p>If your visitors find your website confusing, they won’t come back. And, of the people who leave your
                    website due to a bad experience, 88% are less likely to ever return again. But, on the bright side,
                    if you implement a clean look to your website, you’ll increase conversion rates up to 400%.</p><br>
                <p>To make sure your website looks clean, use lots of whitespace in your product images, navigational
                    elements, and typography.</p><br>
                <p>This makes it easy for your visitors to ‘scan’ your website and digest the information presented
                    within. It will help you increase focus on the parts of the website you want.</p><br>
                <img src="img/image8.png">
                <p>The black background you see here in Apple’s website isn’t useless. It acts as a whitespace which
                    puts focus on what matters, i.e., the navigation menu, heading, and the image of the iPhone.</p><br>
                <h3>4. Find Your Website’s ‘Voice’</h3>
                <p>In real life, the tone in which you text your mom and dad is probably different from the way you text
                    your best friend. Similarly, your website’s ‘tone’ will be different depending on the audience it
                    serves.</p><br>
                <p>If it’s targeted towards millennials and is for a productivity item, you might want to speak in a
                    ‘fun’ voice. On the other hand, if you deal with Fortune 500 CEOs, you might want your website to
                    speak in a more professional tone.</p><br>
                <p>Again, your brand story plays a great role in deciding this.</p>
                <h3>5. Optimize Your Website’s User Experience (UX)</h3>
                <p>Steve Jobs once famously said that “design is not how it looks, it’s how it works”.</p><br>
                <p>The same holds true for your website’s design.</p><br>
                <p>It doesn’t matter how beautiful your website is, or how many animations and graphics it has; if it
                    doesn’t load properly, you’ll lose visitors and, more importantly, your sales.</p><br>
                <p>To make sure this doesn’t happen, it’s important to optimize your website for speed and performance.
                    Here are three ways you can do that:</p><br>
                <p><b>Create a mobile version of your website:</b> Today, more people access the internet from their
                    phones. That’s why it’s important to make your website ‘responsive’ — meaning it loads the mobile
                    version when accessed from phones.</p><br>
                <p><b>Use a CDN network to load your website quickly:</b> A CDN network stores your media files in
                    servers around the world, so when users request access to your website, they get directed to a
                    server that’s closer to their region. This makes your website load quickly for all your visitors, no
                    matter where they are.</p><br>
                <p><b>Compress your images with an image compressor:</b> An image compressor simply reduces the size of
