                <h2>How to Make Your Website Look Beautiful When You’re Not a Designer</h2>
                <h5><i>(Last Update On: January, 25 2023)</i></h5>
                <p>It might not seem like such a big deal, but the way your website looks matters a lot. In a recent
                    study by Forrester Research, they found that a well designed interface can increase conversion rates
                    on your website by 200%.</p><br>
                <p>But designing your own website is hard.</p><br>
                <p>Where do you start? Which font should you choose? Which color? Where should the menus go? These — and
                    many other questions — can make you give up before you even get started.</p><br>
                <h3>Step 1: Choose the Tools You’ll Use To Build Your Website</h3>
                <p>The many tools available online are what make it possible for you to design and construct your own
                    website without hiring a web designer.</p><br>
                <p>Right now, there are two ideal types of software you can use to design your website:</p><br>
                <p><b>1. Content Management System (CMS):</b>A content management system, like WordPress, is the easiest
                    tool with which you can design your website. That’s because it comes with templates, which are
                    ready-made website designs you can simply install and customize until you get the look you want.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>2. Website Builders:</b>A website builder is a drag-and-drop tool which lets you design a website
                    professionally without any special knowledge. You control the look of each and every element
                    (textbox, widget, button, etc.) and can change its design and location just by using your mouse.</p>
                <br>
                <p>If you want to get through designing your website quickly, you should choose a CMS. But if you want
                    to have more control over the design of your website, you should choose a website builder.</p><br>
                <h3>Step 2: Prepare Your Website’s Wireframe</h3>
                <p><b>Note: If you’re going to use a CMS and its templates for your website’s design, you can skip this
                        step. But, if you’ll be starting from scratch with a website builder, read on.</b></p><br>
                <p>If you are really ambitious about creating a unique design for your website, you should start by
                    building a wireframe.</p><br>
                <p>A wireframe is a structural representation that shows what your website will look like. Think of it
                    as your website’s blueprint, which, like a blueprint for a house, will guide you on how to build
                    your website.</p><br>
                <p>Here is an example of a wireframe for Back To My Body’s website:</p><br>
                <img src="img/wireframe.jpg">
                <p>This simple wireframe gives a solid idea what the dashboard will look like.</p>
                <p>It shows</p><br>
                <p>1. The structure of the website</p>
                <p>2. The website’s navigational hierarchy</p>
                <p>3. Which content pieces will go where</p><br>
                <p>You don’t need to use fancy software to design your website’s wireframe. You can simply use a good
                    ol’ piece of paper and a pen to create a wireframe like this:</p><br>
                <img src="img/image5.png">
                <h3>Step 3: Identify What Pages Your Website Will Have</h3>
                <p>Before you start the wireframe process (or edit a template), you’re going to decide what pages your
                    website will have. And to do that, you’ll have to ask yourself what’s the number one thing you want
                    your website to do.</p><br>
                <p>Do you want it to sell products? Showcase information and articles? Tell what your service or
                    products are capable of? Introduce your company or business?</p><br>
                <p>Once you answer this question, it will become easier for you to decide what pages you want on your
                    website.</p><br>
                <p>Here are some common pages many websites have:</p><br>
                <p>1. Homepage</p>
                <p>2. Blog</p>
                <p>3. About Us</p>
                <p>4. Contact</p>
                <p>5. Pricing</p><br>
                <p>Of these pages, the most common page on every single website (which your website will have as well)
                    is the homepage.</p><br>
